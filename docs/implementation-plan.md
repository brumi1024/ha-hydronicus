# Hydronic Climate implementation plan

Status: Draft

## Purpose

Hydronic Climate is a standalone Home Assistant custom integration for dynamically configured hydronic heating and cooling plants.
It exposes climate controls for comfort zones while safely coordinating shared hydraulic circuits, valves, pumps, heat sources, and safety interlocks.
The integration is generic and must not contain entity IDs, topology, names, or assumptions belonging to any particular home.

## Product constraints

- The integration lives in its own public GitHub repository.
- The integration is installable through HACS.
- All normal configuration and reconfiguration happens through the Home Assistant UI.
- One Home Assistant config entry represents one hydronic plant.
- A Home Assistant instance may contain multiple independent plants.
- A plant may contain any number of zones, sensors, circuits, actuators, pumps, sources, and interlocks.
- Relationships between plant objects are many-to-many.
- Shared equipment is owned by the central controller, never directly by a zone.
- Heating and cooling are part of the domain model from the beginning.
- New plants start in shadow mode.
- Physical safety remains enforced by appropriate hardware independently of Home Assistant.
- Configuration migrations preserve user topology across releases.
- The project targets current Home Assistant integration conventions and quality requirements.

## Version 1 scope

Version 1 includes:

- Dynamic plant topology.
- Comfort-zone climate entities.
- Multiple temperature and humidity sensors per zone.
- Configurable sensor aggregation.
- Multiple circuits per zone.
- Multiple zones per circuit.
- Shared valves and pumps.
- Binary switch and native valve actuators.
- Heating and cooling demand.
- Dew-point and supply-temperature interlocks.
- Minimum runtime and minimum rest periods.
- Valve pre-opening and pump overrun.
- Heat-source demand and source changeover.
- Shadow mode.
- Human-readable control explanations.
- Repairs and downloadable diagnostics.
- HACS installation and GitHub releases.

Version 1 does not include:

- A custom frontend panel or Lovelace card.
- Automatic hydraulic topology discovery.
- Manufacturer-specific heat-pump protocols.
- Writing manufacturer weather curves.
- Tariff, solar-surplus, or forecast optimization.
- Model-predictive control.
- Automatic hydraulic balancing.
- Arbitrary templates or unrestricted Boolean expressions.
- An internal scheduling system.

Home Assistant automations, schedules, and dashboards may change climate targets without Hydronic Climate owning scheduling policy.

## Domain model

### Plant

A Plant is one hydraulically coordinated heating and cooling installation.
It owns the operating mode, topology, runtime controller, sources, interlocks, and shadow or active control state.

### Comfort Zone

A Comfort Zone is a group of spaces governed by one comfort target.
It owns target temperatures, supported modes, sensors, aggregation policy, tolerances, minimum demand durations, and presets.
A Comfort Zone never directly switches physical equipment.

### Hydraulic Circuit

A Hydraulic Circuit is an independently describable water path through one emitter group.
Examples include a floor loop group, ceiling loop group, radiator branch, or towel-dryer branch.
It owns emitter type, supported modes, temperature limits, valve path, pump path, and stabilization timings.

### Delivery Route

A Delivery Route connects one Comfort Zone to one Hydraulic Circuit.
This explicit relationship allows one zone to use multiple circuits and multiple zones to share one circuit.
A route owns mode eligibility, priority, arbitration policy, and enable state.

### Actuator

An Actuator is a physical entity that changes the plant.
Initial actuator kinds are binary valve, native Home Assistant valve, pump, source selector, and heat or cool request switch.
Each actuator tracks desired state, observed state, active consumers, transition state, timings, and optional feedback.

### Heat Source

A Heat Source provides usable heating or cooling water.
Initial source kinds are externally controlled source, heat-pump demand output, temperature-qualified buffer, and source behind a selector valve.

### Safety Interlock

A Safety Interlock is a condition that must permit an operation.
Examples include dew-point margin, supply-temperature limits, flow confirmation, pump health, source availability, sensor freshness, and a physical condensation input.

### Coupled Delivery Group

A Coupled Delivery Group contains zones that share equipment in a way that prevents independent hydraulic control.
The integration must identify this topology and explain that separate thermostat entities cannot overcome the physical coupling.

## Architectural seams

The implementation has three primary modules.
The safety-critical behavior belongs behind a small deterministic controller interface.
Home Assistant state observation and service calls remain adapters around that interface.

### Topology compiler

Interface:

```python
def compile_topology(configuration: PlantConfiguration) -> CompiledPlant:
    """Validate and compile a plant configuration."""
```

Responsibilities:

- Resolve UUID references.
- Build an acyclic dependency graph.
- Detect shared actuators.
- Compile demand and permit relationships.
- Detect incompatible modes.
- Detect orphaned objects.
- Produce validation errors and warnings.
- Produce a human-readable logic summary.

The topology compiler does not read Home Assistant states or issue service calls.

### Hydronic controller

Interface:

```python
def evaluate(
    plant: CompiledPlant,
    snapshot: PlantSnapshot,
    runtime: RuntimeState,
    now: datetime,
) -> Evaluation:
    """Return the next runtime state and desired control plan."""
```

Result:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Evaluation:
    next_runtime: RuntimeState
    control_plan: ControlPlan
    diagnostics: ControllerDiagnostics
```

Responsibilities:

- Aggregate zone sensors.
- Calculate heating and cooling demand.
- Apply hysteresis and minimum durations.
- Resolve delivery routes.
- Resolve shared-actuator consumers.
- Apply safety interlocks.
- Advance actuator state machines.
- Detect conflicts.
- Return idempotent desired commands.
- Explain every requested, idle, and blocked decision.

The hydronic controller is deterministic and contains no Home Assistant imports.

### Home Assistant runtime adapter

Responsibilities:

- Observe configured Home Assistant entities.
- Subscribe to relevant state changes.
- Schedule periodic reconciliation.
- Translate Home Assistant states into a PlantSnapshot.
- Call the hydronic controller.
- Execute a ControlPlan.
- Publish Home Assistant entities.
- Raise Repairs issues.
- Generate diagnostics.
- Reload safely after configuration changes.

Tests use a fake runtime adapter across the same seam.

## Topology semantics

Most AND and OR behavior is inferred from topology rather than programmed by the user.

### Circuit demand

```text
circuit request =
    OR of eligible delivery-route demands
```

### Valve demand

```text
valve request =
    OR of requesting circuits that consume the valve
```

A valve turns off only when its active-consumer set is empty.

### Circuit readiness

```text
circuit ready =
    circuit requested
    AND every required valve ready
    AND every applicable safety interlock permits operation
```

### Pump demand

```text
pump request =
    OR of ready circuits served by the pump
    AND every pump permit
```

### Plant demand

```text
plant request =
    OR of running pump paths with active circuit demand
    AND every source permit
```

### Safe arbitration policies

Version 1 supports:

- `any_demand`
- `all_demand`
- `priority`
- `at_least_n`
- `weighted_threshold`

Free-form templates and unrestricted expression trees are not supported.

## Active-consumer ownership

No zone sends an unconditional off command to a shared actuator.
The controller calculates the complete active-consumer set for each actuator during every evaluation.

Example:

```text
underfloor pump consumers:
  - living floor circuit
  - basement floor circuit
```

If the living circuit releases demand, only that consumer is removed.
The pump remains requested while the basement circuit is still a consumer.

## Actuator state machines

### Valve states

```text
CLOSED
OPENING
OPEN
CLOSING
FAULT
UNKNOWN
```

### Pump states

```text
OFF
WAITING_FOR_VALVES
STARTING
RUNNING
OVERRUN
LOCKOUT
FAULT
UNKNOWN
```

### Source states

```text
UNAVAILABLE
IDLE
CHANGEOVER
ACTIVE
MINIMUM_DWELL
FAULT
```

### Start sequence

1. Evaluate zone demand.
2. Resolve eligible delivery routes.
3. Request required valves.
4. Wait for position feedback or configured opening time.
5. Mark eligible circuits ready.
6. Request pumps.
7. Confirm pump power or flow when configured.
8. Assert plant demand.
9. Select or enable the source.

### Stop sequence

1. Release source demand when no plant demand remains.
2. Apply source minimum dwell where required.
3. Apply pump overrun.
4. Stop pumps whose consumer sets are empty.
5. Close valves whose consumer sets are empty.
6. Preserve equipment required by other circuits.

Commands are always explicit `turn_on`, `turn_off`, `open`, or `close` operations.
Toggle commands are forbidden.

## Zone control

### Sensor aggregation

Version 1 supports:

- Designated reference sensor.
- Mean.
- Median.
- Weighted mean.
- Heating-oriented minimum.
- Cooling-oriented maximum.

Each sensor may define a weight, calibration offset, maximum age, and required or optional status.

### Demand calculation

Version 1 uses:

- Separate heating and cooling deadbands.
- Separate start and stop thresholds.
- Minimum active duration.
- Minimum idle duration.
- Demand smoothing.
- Long-cycle behavior suitable for radiant slabs.
- Optional staged emitter activation.

PID and predictive strategies are deferred until there are two proven strategies that justify a strategy seam.

## Cooling safety

Cooling requires:

- Temperature and humidity observations for every required zone.
- A usable supply or surface-temperature reference.
- A configured condensation margin.
- A cooling-compatible circuit.
- Valid source and pump paths.
- No conflicting heating demand on shared equipment.

Cooling fails closed if a required sensor is unavailable or stale.
A physical condensation interlock remains strongly recommended and is independent of software protection.

## Heat-source control

Source selection supports:

- Eligibility checks.
- Priority.
- Required supply temperature.
- Temperature-qualified buffer availability.
- Hysteresis.
- Minimum source dwell.
- Break-before-make changeover.
- Shadow-only source recommendation.
- Deterministic fallback.

Source control is implemented after stable heating control and before production cooling control.

## Home Assistant configuration

One config entry represents one Plant.
Dynamic objects use config subentries where the Home Assistant interface is suitable.

Recommended subentry types:

- `zone`
- `circuit`
- `actuator`
- `source`
- `interlock`

Every topology object receives a generated UUID.
Relationships use UUIDs rather than display names.

### Initial setup flow

1. Create a Plant.
2. Select supported operating modes.
3. Confirm shadow mode.
4. Add the first Comfort Zone.
5. Assign sensors.
6. Add a Hydraulic Circuit.
7. Add Actuators.
8. Connect a Delivery Route.
9. Review the compiled topology.
10. Finish setup.

### Reconfiguration menu

- Plant settings.
- Zones.
- Circuits.
- Actuators.
- Sources.
- Interlocks.
- Topology review.
- Configuration validation.
- Physical-control enablement.
- Safe shutdown.

New Plants start in shadow mode.
Enabling physical control requires a valid topology and explicit confirmation.

## Home Assistant entities

### Zone entities

- One `climate` entity.
- Demand binary sensor.
- Aggregated temperature sensor.
- Aggregated humidity sensor.

- Shadow-mode switch.
- Plant-demand binary sensor.
- Active-source sensor.
- Topology-valid binary sensor.
- Controller-state sensor.
- Safe-shutdown button.

## Test strategy

### Pure controller tests

- Demand thresholds.
- Sensor aggregation.
- Active-consumer ownership.
- Valve sequencing.
- Pump sequencing.
- Source sequencing.
- Minimum runtime.
- Lockout.
- Cooling interlocks.
- Conflict arbitration.
- Explanations.
- Restart reconstruction.

All time-sensitive tests use a fake clock.

### Property-based invariants

Generated topologies must prove:

- No actuator stops while it has active consumers.
- Pumps cannot run without ready downstream circuits.
- Sources cannot run without permitted hydraulic demand.
- Cooling cannot run through a blocked condensation interlock.
- Cyclic graphs are rejected.
- Evaluation is deterministic.
- Re-evaluating an unchanged snapshot produces no new command.

### Home Assistant adapter tests

- Config flow.
- Every subentry flow.
- Reconfigure and delete.
- Entry setup, unload, and reload.
- Entity creation and unique IDs.
- Referenced entity removal.
- Service-call translation.
- Diagnostics redaction.
- Repairs creation and removal.
- Translation loading.
- Config migration.

### Named operating scenarios

- `two_zones_release_shared_pump_independently`
- `coupled_zones_share_one_valve`
- `living_zone_stages_floor_and_ceiling`
- `pump_fault_blocks_only_dependent_circuits`
- `cooling_stops_before_condensation_margin_is_crossed`
- `buffer_becomes_ineligible_during_active_heating`
- `restart_while_valve_is_opening`
- `manual_pump_override_is_detected`
- `zone_sensor_becomes_stale`
- `heat_to_cool_changeover_waits_for_safe_idle`

## Pilot rollout

### Stage 1: Synthetic

Use fake sensors and input booleans only.

### Stage 2: Shadow

Use real sensors and observed equipment without service calls.

### Stage 3: Partial heating control

Control one heating circuit while the heat source remains independently controlled.
Provide immediate manual rollback.

### Stage 4: Full heating control

Control all heating circuits and shared pumps.
Keep cooling and source switching in shadow mode.

Cooling and source switching each repeat the staged rollout independently.

## Release and HACS policy

- Use semantic versioning.
- Publish GitHub Releases rather than tags alone.
- Run HACS validation and Hassfest on pushes, pull requests, and scheduled checks.
- Keep the integration under one `custom_components/hydronic_climate` directory.
- Keep all runtime files inside the integration directory.
- Include root-level `hacs.json`.
- Include `domain`, `documentation`, `issue_tracker`, `codeowners`, `name`, and `version` in `manifest.json`.
- Include complete English custom-integration translations in `translations/en.json`.
- Select the minimum supported Home Assistant version after the config-subentry prototype identifies the earliest version covered by CI.
- Do not submit for HACS default inclusion before a stable release and independent use.

## Initial architectural decisions

- Repository name: `ha-hydronic-climate`.
- Integration domain: `hydronic_climate`.
- License: MIT.
- Implementation language: Python.
- Runtime style: asynchronous.
- Configuration: Home Assistant config entries and subentries.
- New Plant control mode: shadow.
- Initial control algorithm: hysteresis and long-cycle demand.
- User logic: fixed validated arbitration policies.
- Zone interface: Home Assistant climate entity.
- Plant mode interface: plant-level mode selector.
- Source integration: generic entity adapters before vendor-specific support.

## Open design questions

These questions should be resolved through prototypes before their related milestone begins:

1. Whether Delivery Routes need their own config subentry or remain relationships owned by zones and circuits.
2. How a plant-level operating mode constrains zone climate modes in the clearest Home Assistant UI.
3. How entity references survive user renames while remaining compatible with normal Home Assistant selectors.
4. Which observed feedback qualifies an actuator as ready when several feedback signals are available.
5. How best-effort safe shutdown behaves during Home Assistant shutdown when service calls may no longer complete.
6. Whether actuator manual override should reassert control, suspend the dependent route, or be user-configurable.
7. Which diagnostic entities should be enabled by default without producing Recorder noise.

## Definition of done

The integration is complete when a user can install it through HACS, create an arbitrary hydronic topology through the UI, understand the compiled control logic, validate it in shadow mode, and safely enable heating, cooling, and source coordination without editing YAML or source code.
Every shared actuator must remain controlled by the complete current consumer set.
Every safety decision must be visible and explainable.
Every safety-critical invariant must be covered by automated tests.
